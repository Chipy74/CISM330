                <img src="images/valoranticon.png" alt="Valorant Logo">
                <p>Valorant is more than just a game for meâ€”it's a competitive passion. I actively play ranked, refining my skills, strategizing with my team, and constantly working to improve. The intense tactical gameplay and precise gunplay make every match a challenge. I also play competitively for my college, always striving to bring my best and achieve the win.</p>

                <h2>Minecraft - Endless Creativity</h2>
                <img src="images/minecraft.png" alt="Minecraft Animation Still">
                <p>Minecraft has been a part of my gaming journey for years. Whether I'm building intricate structures, surviving against mobs, or exploring vast underground caves, the game never gets old. I enjoy both vanilla and modded. Playing with friends and creating massive worlds together is one of the most rewarding experiences Minecraft has to offer.</p>

                <h2>Rust - Survival at Its Toughest</h2>
                <img src="images/rust.jpg" alt="Rust Gameplay">
                <p>Rust is the ultimate test of survival skills. From gathering resources and building a base to defending against raids, every moment in Rust is unpredictable. The player-driven economy, intense PVP encounters, and harsh environment make it a unique and exhilarating experience. While it can be brutal, there's nothing more satisfying than starting from nothing and building up a powerful base with a group.</p>
